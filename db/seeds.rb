# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Place.create(name: "QuickStop", address: "58 Leonard Ave, Leonardo, NJ 07737")
# Place.create(name: "Sceret Stash", address: "65 Broad St, Red Bank, NJ 07701")
# Place.create(name: "Amityville House", address: "112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville NY 1170")
